This is the introductory module. It will contain content, links to video and page-based content with critical lessons to be learned. Maybe some presentations, etc.

Interested to know at the moment how it appears in the site framework that I can hopefully build up over time into something nice. I can do the same with MSBA 8180 and the programming course.
